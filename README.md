### Project-Overview
This project is an advanced Information Retrieval System designed to handle image-based queries. Trained on a comprehensive laptop dataset, our model takes an image as input and allows you to ask detailed questions about it. The twist? We assume you have no prior knowledge about the image.

Leveraging the power of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), our system intelligently retrieves information from manuals and answers your questions based on the image data provided. Whether you're looking for specs, features, or troubleshooting info, our model has got you covered.

You can start to replicate this project by cloning this repo.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/sugam21/InsightAI.git
